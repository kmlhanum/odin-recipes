    <h2>How to Make it</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix the rice flour and mung bean starch in a bowl. Gradually add the pandan leaf water while stirring until the batter is well mixed and smooth (not lumpy).</li>
        <li>Cook the batter over medium heat, stirring constantly until it thickens and is cooked through. Remove from heat and let it cool slightly.</li>
        <li>Prepare a cendol mold or a perforated strainer. Pour the batter into the mold and press it so the cendol comes out and drops into a bowl filled with ice water. Let the cendol harden, then drain.</li>
        <li>To make the liquid palm sugar, dissolve the grated palm sugar with a little water over low heat until the sugar is completely dissolved. Strain to remove impurities, then let it cool.</li>
        <li>Mix the coconut milk with a pinch of salt, stirring well. Heat briefly until it boils, then remove and let it cool.</li>
        <li>Serve the Es Cendol by mixing the cendol, liquid palm sugar, coconut milk, and ice cubes, according to taste.</li>
